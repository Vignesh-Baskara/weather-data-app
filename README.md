## How It Works
main.py: The main script that sets up the Streamlit interface. It includes a title, text input, slider, selectbox, and subheader to let users interact with the weather forecast data. It uses get_data from backend.py to fetch weather information and displays either temperature plots or sky condition images.
backend.py: Contains a function get_data that fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the userâ€™s input. It returns a filtered list of forecast data.
